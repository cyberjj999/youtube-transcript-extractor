hi i'm Jia Jun and i am an aspiring entrepreneur my greatest takeaway from nyp is learning how to learn for example in our modules in nyp our lecturers actually provide us with the toolset technology to solve various problems this allows us to actually explore ourselves to inculcate a inquisitive mindset and allow us to become a lifelong learner being 

a google developer student club they provide me with the opportunities to participate in google technology conference network googlers and even visit google singapore office through this different initiative i'm actually able to start a club in nyp call nypd developers doing club and through all these experiences i've definitely learned to become a better communicator and a greater leader 

one of the challenges that i can vividly remember is hosting an info session for nyp developer student club this is the first event that i take full control and responsibility for it involves i will give a 30 minute long speech to nearly 100 students in a lecture theater and my lack of confidence and introverted nature proved to 

be a huge roadblock however i am truly glad that everything went smoothly i credit the success of this event to two things firstly my determination in wanting to deliver the best speech despite feeling nervous i found a way to calm myself down by reading off a script instead of trying to recall information during the presentation secondly i'm 

very thankful for my teammates who are so supportive of me as well kohinity has taught me to not take things for granted and to always be grateful and therefore i choose to be optimistic and look at the brighter side of things
